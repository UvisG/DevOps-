Step 1: Installation of MetalLB
To practice the installation of MetalLB on your local environment, the following manifests must be deployed on the control-plane:

namespace.yaml creates a MetalLB namespace;
metallb.yaml deploys the MetalLB controller and speakers, as well as the role bindings and listeners that are needed.
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.12.1/manifests/namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.12.1/manifests/metallb.yaml
Once MetalLB is installed, we must configure an IP address pool. By deploying it, the controller allocates IP addresses for the load-balancer. The IP address pool allows for one or many IP addresses, depending on what we need. The allocated addresses must be part of the host network of our cluster and unique.

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  namespace: metallb-system
  name: config
data:
  config: |
    address-pools:
    - name: default
      protocol: layer2
      addresses:
      - {ip-start}-{ip-stop}
Save this file under the name config-pool.yaml and simply apply it using kubectl apply -f config-pool.yaml.
